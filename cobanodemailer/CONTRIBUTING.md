# Contributing to Nodemailer

Thank you for showing interest in the development of Nodemailer. Unfortunately in most cases I won't be able to accept any patches to avoid conflicts with the commercial license of Nodemailer.

Instead I suggest you to open an issue ticket instead. Describe the problem and possible fix in the issue description if it's a bugfix. For new features describe the feature that you would want to have.
